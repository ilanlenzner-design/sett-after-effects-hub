# 🧠 Smart Text Copywriter for After Effects

**Smart Text Copywriter** is an AI-powered After Effects extension designed to supercharge your workflow for game ads, social media content, and motion graphics. It combines LLM text generation with direct After Effects property manipulation to write, style, and animate text in seconds.

### 🎨 Intelligent Styling
*   **🖍️ Power Highlighter:** Automatically identifies key "Power Words" (like *Free, Epic, Win*) and highlights them in **Gold + Bold** style.
*   **📐 Smart Wrap:** uses AI to intelligently break long sentences into balanced, centered visual stacks (instead of random line breaks).
*   **🎭 Sentiment Styler:** Analyzes the emotion of your text and applies a matching color palette (e.g., "Warning" → Red/Danger style, "Success" → Gold/Victory style).

### 🎬 Instant Motion
*   **Pop (Elastic):** Classic springy pop-in animation.
*   **Typewriter:** Clean character-by-character reveal.
